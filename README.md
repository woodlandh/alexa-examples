# alexa-examples
My attempts to write Amazon Alexa skills.

* SlothFacts gives you a random fact about sloths
* CloudAcronymQuiz tests your knowledge of AWS acronyms
* 13MonthCalendar tells you today's date on the obscure calendar

Code base is mostly from [Amazon's samples](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js).
